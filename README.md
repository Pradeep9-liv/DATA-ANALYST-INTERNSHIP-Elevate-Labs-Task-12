## Dataset
- **Name:** HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Format:** CSV

---

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor

## Data Transformation Steps
The following steps were performed in Power Query Editor:

1. Imported the HR Analytics CSV dataset into Power BI.
2. Removed unnecessary columns such as EmployeeCount, Over18, and StandardHours.
3. Renamed column headers for better readability.
4. Checked and handled missing values where applicable.
5. Corrected data types for numeric and categorical columns.
6. Practiced column splitting and merging for transformation understanding.
7. Created conditional columns:
   - **Age Group** (20–30, 31–40, 41–50, 50+)
   - **Salary Band** (Low, Medium, High)
8. Applied changes and loaded the cleaned data model.

## Visualizations Created
1. **Attrition by Age Group**  
   - Clustered column chart showing employee attrition across age groups.

2. **Attrition by Salary Band**  
   - Donut chart representing attrition distribution by salary level.

3. **Department-wise Attrition**  
   - Stacked bar chart comparing attrition across departments.

## Key Insights
- Attrition is higher among certain age groups, especially early-career employees.
- Employees in lower salary bands show relatively higher attrition.
- Some departments experience more attrition compared to others.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI and Power Query for data cleaning,
transformation, and visualization. It highlights how HR analytics dashboards
can support data-driven decision-making related to employee attrition.
